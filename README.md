A [FoundryVTT](http://foundryvtt.com/) module that shows some of the dice + bonus information when hovering over an item/spell/ability/skills/etc. in an actor sheet. <b>Only works with the D&D5E system for now</b>

Especially useful for people that want to roll physical dice, but still maintain all of the convenience that Foundry provides.
